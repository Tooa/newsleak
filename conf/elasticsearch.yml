# ======================== Elasticsearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: Elasticsearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please see the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# <http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-configuration.html>
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
 cluster.name: NewsLeaksCluster
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
 node.name: NewsLeaksNode-1

#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
 network.host: 0.0.0.0
#

# Set a custom port for the node to node communication (9300 by default):
#
 transport.tcp.port: 9501
# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
 http.port: 9500
#
